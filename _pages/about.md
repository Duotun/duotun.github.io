I am a PhD student of Computational Media and Arts at The Hongkong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) and I am fortunate to be co-supervised by [Prof. Mingming Fan](https://www.mingmingfan.com/) and [Prof. Zeyu Wang](https://cislab.hkust-gz.edu.cn/members/zeyu-wang/). I am also a research intern mentored by [Dr. Xiaohang Zhan](https://xiaohangzhan.github.io/) at Tencent AI Lab.

Before returning to research, I gained industrial experience as a software engineer in Rendering & Virtual Reality at ByteDance from 2022 to 2023, and as a research engineer in Simulation Platform for AI at Xiaomi from 2021 to 2022.

I obtained a master's degree in computer science at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.umd.edu/) with a full scholarship in 2021 and a bachelor's degree in computer science with an outstanding graduate award at [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/) in 2019.

During my graduate study, I was supervised by [Prof. Huaishu Peng](http://smartlab.cs.umd.edu/) and worked as research intern within [Document Intelligent Lab at Adobe](https://research.adobe.com/research/document-intelligence/). 

During Mar. 2019 - Jul. 2019,  I was a research intern in the Team of User Experience Design(UXD) at [Lenovo Research](https://research.lenovo.com/webapp/view_English/index.html). In 2016 - 2018, I pursued research experiences under the guidance of [Prof. Wei Liang](https://liangwei-bit.github.io/web/).
 
My research interests include differential geometry for AI-generated content and interactive design in mixed reality.
